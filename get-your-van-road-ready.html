                <h1 class="bp-title">5 Steps To Get Your Van On The Road</h1>
                <p>Before getting started on your conversion, it’s best to know how to get it legally on
                    the road. When
                    you
                    begin your research, you'll find that in Ireland the process can be a little bit confusing, and the
                    required information is a bit all over the place. Here is a step by step guide to help you get clear
                    on
                    what needs to be done, and in what order.
                    <br><br>
                    The first thing to know is that to get your camper insured, it first must be registered as a motor
                    caravan on the logbook. In the eyes of Revenue, for a self-converted van to be considered a
                    motor
                    caravan, it must have the following: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seating and a table</li>
                    <li>A bed (this can be converted from the seats)</li>
                    <li>Cooking facilities</li>
                    <li>Storage facilities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When it comes to cooking facilities and gas, Revenue state that a Gas
                    Installer Certificate should be made available. In my experience, this is not the case. That said,
                    when
                    installing gas, it is recommended that you use a registered gas installer. Having your gas installed
                    by
                    an
                    RGI will give you peace of mind, and the certificate will be of benefit should you ever be selling
                    your
                    camper in the future.
                    <br><br>
                    Below I have set out five key steps to getting your van on the road, one before you start your build
                    and
                    four once you’ve completed your build. This article does not go into specifics on the build
                    itself. You can find information on how to convert your van <a href="diycamperconversion.html"
                        class="bodylink">here</a>.

                <h3 class="bp-heading">Step 1: Speak to the insurance provider.</h3>
                <p>You may be thinking, why would I be doing this before I even start my conversion?
                    The
                    reason is,
                    in
                    Ireland, as mentioned above, there are only basic standardized requirements set out by Revenue
                    to
                    convert a commercial vehicle into a camper. Most insurance providers have additional requirements
                    relating to different areas of your build, particularly gas installation. It’s a good idea to speak
                    to
                    the insurance provider before getting started, avoiding any nasty surprises when it comes time to
                    get
                    the van insured. In Ireland, you have three options, <a class="bodylink"

                <h3 class="bp-heading">Step 2: Get your van weighed.</h3>
                <p>Before your van can be inspected by an SQI (step three), you will need to find a weighbridge in your
                    local area and have your van weighed. Your best bet is to try a local recycling centre. I used <a
                        href="http://marrakeshltd.com/" class="bodylink" target="_blank"> Marrakesh
                        Recycling Centre</a> in Kilmacanogue, Co. Wicklow, costing €20.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="bp-heading">Step 3: Have your van inspected.</h3>
                <p>It’s now time to get an SQI (suitably qualified individual) to certify your conversion. In this case,
                    it
                    will be an automotive engineer. The SQI will inspect the vehicle, make sure the conversion is up to
                    spec
                    and provide the necessary declaration. The SQI will also take photos of the interior and exterior of
                    your van. These will need to be submitted to Revenue along with your declaration. The cost of
                    the
                    inspection is in the ballpark of €200.
                    <br><br>
                    I would highly recommend using Noel Maher from <a href="https://atecea.ie/" class="bodylink"
                        target="_blank">ATECEA</a>.
                    He is a great person to deal
                    with and has a wealth of knowledge and experience in certifying conversions.

                <br>
                <h3 class="bp-heading">Step 4: Submit your documents to Revenue.</h3>
                <p>Good news, we are almost there! It is time to submit all of your documents to Revenue. These
                    includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vehicle Registration Certificate</li>
                    <li>SQI - Declaration of Conversion</li>
                    <li>Copy of the weigh docket</li>
                    <li>Conversion photographs</li>
                    <li>Cover letter and conversion receipts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your cover letter should briefly outline how you went about your conversion and the associated cost.
                    I
                    have created a cover letter template that you can download <a href="camper-reg-cover-template.docx"
                        class="bodylink" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    All of your documents should be posted to:

                <h3 class="bp-heading">An important note...</h3>
                <p>Based on your application, Revenue will determine the open market value of your newly converted
                    camper. You will then be subject to VRT on that value of 13.3%. This will need to be paid before
                    your
                    camper can be officially registered and insured.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="bp-heading">Step 5: Insuring your van.</h3>
                <p>Your DIY conversion is officially a camper! You can now go about insuring. As mentioned earlier, you
                    have three options, <a class="bodylink" href="https://www.dolmen-insurance.ie/"
                        target="_blank">Dolmen

                    insurer
                    has different terms and conditions; I would recommend
                    taking a look at each and deciding on a provider that suits your needs best.
                    <br><br>
                    And that’s it! As I said, when looking online, this information tends to be a bit all over the
                    place. I
                    hope that you now have a clear understanding of the process and what’s involved. Should you have any
