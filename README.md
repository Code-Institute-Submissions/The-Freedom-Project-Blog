### **Surface**
---
#### **Imagery:**
All the images used will come from my own personal library.

#### **Colors:**
![Color Palette](/assets/images/color-palette.PNG)

Color scheme was created with the aid of [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/).

#### **Typography:**
The font to be used throughout the site is ["Ubuntu"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?preview.text_type=custom) sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## **FEATURES**
Each page has a responsive navigation bar with the logo to the left, page links in the centre, and social media links to the right. Each page has a footer with secondary navigation and social media links.

Each page, except Our Story, has a hero image and heading at the top of the screen. Each image is a photo I have taken during my days in the van. This is to help users build a better connection with the story and the content, it provides consistency across the site, and is visually appealing.

#### **Home:**
The home page features a large hero-image and heading, allowing users to immediately identify the website's purpose. Below the hero image, there is an about section featuring a profile image and a short bio. This details who I am and what the blog is about, helping to create a connection with the user early on in their journey. Following this, there are three article cards, one for a featured article and one for a recent article in both the van conversion and vanlife categories. Each card features an article thumbnail, snippet, and a link to the full text. Finally, there is a mailing list subscription box that is linked to [Mail Chimp](https://mailchimp.com/).

#### **Our Story:**

The Our Story page features a profile image and text detailing who is behind the blog and why it exists.

#### **Contact:**
The contact page features a large banner image with an overlayed heading and a contact form. The required elements of the form are the name, email, and message. Users also have the option to include their social media handle. Form submissions are collected using [FormBackend.com](https://www.formbackend.com/).

#### **DIY Van Conversion & Vanlife in Ireland:**
Each of these pages can be seen as a blog category. Keeping the content separate will allow users to more efficiently source information. The DIY Camper Conversion page currently features a single article. Articles on these pages are displayed in the form of cards with an image, heading, snippet, and a link to the full text. Content for the Vanlife in Ireland page has yet to be created and so a temporary Coming Soon page has been put in place. Each page features a banner image with an overlayed page heading.

#### **Blog Article:**
Each blog article features a banner image with the category heading overlayed. Each article features a 'read on' button at the end of the content allowing users to navigate easily to other articles within the category.

#### **Existing features:**
- Header Logo - Allows users to easily identify the brand. Clicking the logo returns users to the home page.  
- Header Navbar - Allows users to easily navigate the blog’s content.
- Header Social Icons - Quickly shows to users that the blog is present on other channels and allows them to easily navigate to them.

- Brian Macharia - Code Institute Mentor. Guidance throughout the project.

#### **Code:**
- An issue regarding the opacity container being displayed over the hero-image on the home screen was solved thanks to a previous question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15782078/bring-element-to-front-using-css).
- A sticky footer was used on several pages that had insufficient content for larger screen resolutions. The code was sourced from an article on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/).
- How to include a favicon was found on [W3](https://www.w3.org/2005/10/howto-favicon).

#### **A key takeaway from my first development project:**
Once the UX design phase is complete build a project roadmap. Break the project down into logical sections and subsections. List the subsections in the order you are going to create them. Complete a sub, commit, complete another sub, commit, repeat until the section is one hundred per cent complete and commit. Don't chop and change between subs and sections. This will complete the project in a logical order, improve project completion time and improve commits.
