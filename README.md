### **FEATURES**

Each page has a responsive navigation bar with the logo to the left, page links in the centre, and social media links to the right. Each page has a footer with secondary navigation and social media links.

Each page (except ‘Our Story’) has a hero image at the top of the screen. Each image is a photo I have taken during my days in the van. This is to help users build a better connection with the story and the content, it provides consistency across the site, and is visually appealing.

**Home:**

The home page features a large hero-image and text allowing users to clearly identify the purpose of the site as soon as they land. This feature engages the user and is visually appealing.
Below the hero image, there is an ‘our story’ section featuring a profile image and a short bio detailing who I am and what the blog is about. This is to help create a connection to the story and the person behind the content early in the user journey.

Following this, there are three article cards, one for a featured article and one for a recent article in both the van conversion and vanlife categories. Each card features an article thumbnail, snippet, and a link to the full text.


Finally, there is a mailing list subscription box that is linked to [Mail Chimp](https://mailchimp.com/)

**Our Story:**

The ‘Our Story’ page features a profile image and text detailing who is behind the blog and why it exists.

**Contact:**

The contact page features a large banner image and a contact form. The required elements of the form are the name, email, and message. Users also have the option to include their social media handle. Form submissions are collected using [FormBackend.com](https://www.formbackend.com/).

**DIY Van Conversion & Vanlife in Ireland:**

Each of these pages should be seen as a blog category. Keeping the content separate will allow users to more efficiently source information. Content for each of these pages has yet to be created, and so a temporary ‘Coming Soon’ page has been put in place.

- Header Social Icons - Quickly shows to users that the blog is present on other channels and allows them to easily navigate to them.
