## **FEATURES**
Each page has a responsive navigation bar with the logo to the left, page links in the centre, and social media links to the right. Each page has a footer with secondary navigation and social media links.

Each page, except Our Story, has a hero image at the top of the screen. Each image is a photo I have taken during my days in the van. This is to help users build a better connection with the story and the content, it provides consistency across the site, and is visually appealing.

### **Home:**
The home page features a large hero-image and heading, allowing users to immediately identify the website's purpose. Below the hero image, there is an about section featuring a profile image and a short bio. This details who I am and what the blog is about, helping to create a connection with the user early in their journey. Following this, there are three article cards, one for a featured article and one for a recent article in both the van conversion and vanlife categories. Each card features an article thumbnail, snippet, and a link to the full text. Finally, there is a mailing list subscription box that is linked to [Mail Chimp](https://mailchimp.com/)

### **Our Story:**

The Our Story page features a profile image and text detailing who is behind the blog and why it exists.

### **Contact:**
The contact page features a large banner image and a contact form. The required elements of the form are the name, email, and message. Users also have the option to include their social media handle. Form submissions are collected using [FormBackend.com](https://www.formbackend.com/).

### **DIY Van Conversion & Vanlife in Ireland:**
Each of these pages can be seen as a blog category. Keeping the content separate will allow users to more efficiently source information. The DIY Camper Conversion page currently features a single article. Articles on these pages are displayed in the form of cards with an image, heading, snippet, and a link to the full text. Content for the Vanlife in Ireland page has yet to be created and so a temporary Coming Soon page has been put in place.

### **Existing features:**
- Header Logo - Allows users to easily identify the brand. Clicking the logo returns users to the home page.  
- Header Navbar - Allows users to easily navigate the blog’s content.
- Header Social Icons - Quickly shows to users that the blog is present on other channels and allows them to easily navigate to them.
- Footer Secondary Navigation - Allows users to navigate the site without having to scroll to the top of the screen.
